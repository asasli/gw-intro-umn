## Recommended Order

1. **New to clusters?** → `miniconda_cluster.md` — install Python on the cluster first
2. **New to the group?** → `set_up.md` — configure your local machine
3. **Need cluster access?** → `lvk_account.md` — LVK account and LDG login
4. **Want to clone private repos on the cluster?** → `README_SSH_Cluster_Git_Access.md`
5. **Unfamiliar with the terminal?** → `bash_intro.md` — read this before anything else
