# Introduction to GW research at UMN
This repository collects basic steps for research in GW astronomy, based on our activities at UMN.

## Setting up environments (+LIGO account)
[Here]{https://github.com/asasli/gw-intro-umn/blob/main/set_up.md} you can find some instructions on how to set up your local machine, create conda environments with the nessecary packages for GW astronomy and also setting up your account (see instructions [here]{https://github.com/asasli/gw-intro-umn/blob/main/lvk_account.md})!

## Python
The codes we developed are based on ```Python``` programming language. For that reason, I would suggest to start with some introduction in Python. In web, there is a lot material you can start with for your first steps! An organized repo with introdution in Python could be find [here]{https://github.com/asasli/Python_Intro_AUTh}.
