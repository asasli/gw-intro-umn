# Introduction to GW Research at UMN

This repository collects essential steps for conducting research in gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy, based on our activities at the University of Minnesota (UMN).

## Setting Up Environments and LIGO Account

Detailed instructions for setting up your local machine and creating conda environments with the necessary packages for GW astronomy can be found [here](https://github.com/asasli/gw-intro-umn/blob/main/set_up.md). Additionally, if you need to set up your LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) account, follow the guidance provided [here](https://github.com/asasli/gw-intro-umn/blob/main/lvk_account.md).

## Python

The codes in this repository are developed using the `Python` programming language. If you're new to Python, there are plenty of online resources to help you get started! For a structured introduction, check out this organized repository: [Python Intro at AUTh](https://github.com/asasli/Python_Intro_AUTh).

## Parameter Estimation with MCMC

Parameter estimation is a crucial part of GW astronomy, often using techniques like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). [Bayesian Inference and MCMC](https://github.com/asasli/BayesMCMC) is a repository that covers very basic concepts. More content for applications GW astronomy is to be added.

## Waveform Generation

Waveform generation is fundamental for comparing theoretical models with observed GW data. This section will provide resources and examples to help you generate GW waveforms. (Content to be added.)

## Suggested Papers

For an in-depth understanding of GW research, reading the foundational and recent papers in the field is highly recommended. A curated list of suggested papers will be added here soon.

## Machine Learning in GW Astronomy

Machine learning is becoming increasingly important in GW research for tasks such as signal classification, noise reduction, and parameter estimation. UMN and MIT group have developed tools and ML algorithms for such purposes. For more details, please visit [ML4GW repository](https://github.com/ML4GW)
